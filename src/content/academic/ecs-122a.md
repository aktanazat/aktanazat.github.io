This course provides an in-depth exploration of algorithm design and analysis, focusing on the complexity of algorithms and various methods of analysis. Key topics include:

- Complexity of Algorithms: Understanding the theoretical limits of algorithm performance and the bounds on complexity.

- Searching and Sorting: Techniques for efficiently organizing and retrieving data: merge sort, bubble sort, binary search.

- Pattern Matching: Algorithms for finding patterns within data sets.

- Graph Algorithms: Methods for solving problems related to graphs, such as shortest path and network flow: Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, Bellman-Ford, DFS, BFS.

- Algorithm Design Techniques: Including divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and approximation methods.

- NP-Complete Problems: An introduction to computationally hard problems and strategies for dealing with them. 

### Personal Notes

The class was taught by Professor Yelena Frid. 
Lectures were held fairly late (7:40 PM); everything hand-written, rarely any presentations.

I would say it was an informative class, as she prioritized *understanding* over memorization. However, towards the end, when we started on Graph Algorithms, the tempo slowed down.

Quizzes and homework every week. Midterm and Final were not as difficult as anticipated: generous partial credit.
