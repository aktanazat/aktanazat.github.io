### Personal Notes

Taught by Sam King. Pretty chill and funny dude. This course is very interesting and is definitely a must (it's already a requirement for CS/CSE majors). 

Usually regarded as the **hardest** computer science course at UC Davis.

### After Final Thoughts

The final was rough. Sam King said it will be hard, it was **hard**. I am not kidding. But, I got an A, so it's all good. No notes, as the presentations were good enough.
