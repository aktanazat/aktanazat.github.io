This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer architecture and digital design. Key topics include:
- Combinational and Sequential Digital Design: Understanding Boolean algebra, gates, and commonly used MSI circuits such as multiplexers and decoders.

- Simple Arithmetic Circuits: Design and implementation of basic arithmetic operations.

- Latches and Flip-Flops: Essential components for building memory and state machines.

- Finite State Machine Design: Techniques for designing and analyzing state machines.

- Interrupts and Interconnection Hardware: Including hardware interrupts, synchronous and asynchronous buses, and bus arbitration.

- Memory: Types of memory, decoding of system-level to chip-level addresses, caches, and the memory hierarchy.

- Hardware Support for Operating Systems: Optimizing resource usage and implementing the abstraction of a separate machine for each user.

### Personal Notes

This class was taught by Professor Matthew Farrens. 

Very informative class. If you want to **learn** computer architecture, definitely take it with Farrens.

Three exams, a final, and four labs throughout the quarter. Provides practice midterms from past years to prepare for the exams, no answer keys, though (need to go to his office hours for that). No MCQ, only free response.

Overall, a nice class. I enjoyed it.
