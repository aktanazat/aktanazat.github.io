This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer architecture and digital design. Key topics include:
- Combinational and Sequential Digital Design: Understanding Boolean algebra, gates, and commonly used MSI circuits such as multiplexers and decoders.

- Simple Arithmetic Circuits: Design and implementation of basic arithmetic operations.

- Latches and Flip-Flops: Essential components for building memory and state machines.

- Finite State Machine Design: Techniques for designing and analyzing state machines.

- Interrupts and Interconnection Hardware: Including hardware interrupts, synchronous and asynchronous buses, and bus arbitration.

- Memory: Types of memory, decoding of system-level to chip-level addresses, caches, and the memory hierarchy.

- Hardware Support for Operating Systems: Optimizing resource usage and implementing the abstraction of a separate machine for each user.
