This course provides an in-depth study of analog circuits and advanced methods of analysis. Key topics include:

- Frequency Response: Understanding how circuits respond to different frequencies and how to analyze and design circuits with specific frequency characteristics.

- SPICE Simulation: Using SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) software to model and analyze circuits.

- Laplace Transform: A mathematical tool used to analyze linear time-invariant systems.

- Fourier Transformations: Techniques for analyzing signals in the frequency domain.

- Two-Port Networks: Analysis and design of two-port networks.

- Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps): Design and application of op-amps in various circuits, including amplifiers, filters, and oscillators. 

- Filters: Design and analysis of both active and passive filters.

### Personal Notes

Taught by Weijian Yang. Need I say more? GOAT. Exams were expectable, usually had the exact same "harder" homework problems. Was supportive, TA's held review sessions every Tuesday. Exams graded fairly quickly, and fairly. At the end, he curved the average to a B-. If you can take EEC 100 with Professor Yang, definitely do.

Notes are not provided since they contain a lot of my personal blabber.
