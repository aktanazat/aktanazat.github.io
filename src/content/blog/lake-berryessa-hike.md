On February 17, I, alongside three other friends, headed out to a hike near Lake Berryessa. Why? Cause why not. 

We started around 9:40 PM near [Stebbins Cold Canyon](https://naturalreserves.ucdavis.edu/stebbins-cold-canyon), maintained by UC Davis.

Upon arrival, we had to cross a creek (otherwise we couldn't continue the trail), and then walk upwards a steep incline. It sort-of reminded me of Mission Peak down in Fremont. 

At the trail head, we followed the trail which arrives to Annie's Junction from the bottom, and then continued our way back through the 1st summit. 

At the peak, the views were breathtaking, to say the least.

On the way back, we stopped to take a look at the [Monticello Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello_Dam). I saw the infamous glory hole, which was absurdly big.

If you look in the picture, it is at the bottom.

Overall, it was a nice hike. Definitely not too easy, but I wouldn't call it difficult. 

We finished the hike around 2:00 PM, and headed to Happy Lamb Hot Pot for some food.
