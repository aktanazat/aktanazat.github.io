      Hi there! I am Aktan, a third year undergraduate <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/majors/computer-science-and-engineering">Computer Science & Engineering</a> student at the University of California, Davis. 
      I am an upcoming Summer 2025 Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.rigetti.com">Rigetti Computing</a>.
      In addition, I am a researcher at <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/">UC Davis Health</a> under David Liem and Clodomir Santana Jr in the Complex Care Laboratory, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, my academic interests lie in machine learning (RAG and GNNs), computer vision (3D reconstruction), and mathematical finance (options pricing and risk management).
